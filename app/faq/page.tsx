                Why does Databasus not use raw SQL dump format for PostgreSQL?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Databasus uses the <code>pg_dump</code>&apos;s{" "}
                <strong>directory format</strong> with{" "}
                <strong>zstd compression at level 5</strong> instead of the
                plain SQL format because it provides the most efficient balance
                between:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Backup creation speed</li>
                <li>Restore speed</li>
                <li>
                  File size compression (up to 20x times smaller than plain SQL
                  format)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This decision was made after extensive testing and benchmarking
                of different PostgreSQL backup formats and compression methods.

                .
              </p>

              <p>Databasus will not include raw SQL dump format, because:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>extra variety is bad for UX;</li>

                Databasus is installed in <code>/opt/databasus/</code>{" "}

                Why doesn&apos;t Databasus support PITR (Point-in-Time
                Recovery)?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Databasus intentionally focuses on logical backups rather than
                PITR for several practical reasons:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Complex setup requirements</strong> — PITR tools
                  typically need to be installed on the same server as your
                  database, requiring direct filesystem access and careful
                  configuration
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Restoration limitations</strong> — incremental backups
                  cannot be restored without direct access to the database
                  storage drive
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cloud incompatibility</strong> — managed cloud
                  databases (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure) don&apos;t allow
                  restoring external PITR backups, making them useless for
                  cloud-hosted PostgreSQL
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Built-in cloud PITR</strong> — cloud providers already
                  offer native PITR capabilities, and even they typically
                  default to hourly or daily granularity
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Practical sufficiency</strong> — for 99% of projects,
                  hourly or daily logical backups provide adequate recovery
                  points without the operational complexity of WAL archiving
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                So instead of second-by-second restoration complexity, Databasus
                prioritizes an intuitive UX for individuals and teams, making it
                the most reliable tool for managing multiple databases and day
                to day use.
              </p>

              <h2 id="ai-usage">How is AI used in Databasus development?</h2>

              <p>
                There have been questions about AI usage in project development
                in issues and discussions. As the project focuses on security,
                reliability and production usage, it&apos;s important to explain
                how AI is used in the development process.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>AI is used as a helper for:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Verification of code quality and searching for vulnerabilities
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cleaning up and improving documentation, comments and code
                </li>
                <li>Assistance during development</li>
                <li>Double-checking PRs and commits after human review</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>AI is NOT used for:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Writing entire code</li>
                <li>&quot;Vibe code&quot; approach</li>
                <li>Code without line-by-line verification by a human</li>
                <li>Code without tests</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>The project has:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Solid test coverage (both unit and integration tests)</li>
                <li>
                  CI/CD pipeline automation with tests and linting to ensure
                  code quality
                </li>
                <li>
                  Verification by experienced developers with experience in
                  large and secure projects
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                So AI is just an assistant and a tool for developers to increase
                productivity and ensure code quality. The work is done by
                developers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Moreover, it&apos;s important to note that we do not
                differentiate between bad human code and AI vibe code. There are
                strict requirements for any code to be merged to keep the
                codebase maintainable.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even if code is written manually by a human, it&apos;s not
                guaranteed to be merged. Vibe code is not allowed at all and all
                such PRs are rejected by default (see{" "}
                <a href="/contribute">contributing guide</a>).
              </p>

              <p>
                We also draw attention to fast issue resolution and security{" "}

              <p>
                If you want to backup your Databasus instance (including all
                configurations, databases and credentials), follow these steps:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Go to <code>/opt/databasus</code> (or the folder where you
                  installed Databasus)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Navigate to the <code>databasus-data</code> directory
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                <strong>You need to backup:</strong>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>secret.key</code> — encryption key for your credentials
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>/pgdata</code> — internal PostgreSQL database of
                  Databasus that contains all your configurations and backup
                  metadata
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you use local storage for backups, you can also backup the{" "}
                <code>backups</code> folder.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>secret.key</code> file alone is
                not sufficient to restore encrypted backups. You also need the{" "}
                <code>/pgdata</code> folder, which contains the encryption
                metadata required for decryption.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>To restore Databasus on another server:</strong> simply
                recreate the <code>databasus-data</code> folder structure with
                the backed up files and start Databasus.
